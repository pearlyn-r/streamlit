In 1970 a syndicate of international banks arranged a loan to Iran for telecommunications infrastructure investment. It was a floating rate loan linked to an average of London interbank lending rates. The average rate was the first LIBOR index. Global capital markets, shut down since the 1929 stock market crash, had begun to open again. New IBOR indices evolved to meet demand for floating rate loans.Libor - 18 banks send everyday estimates on what they think they would have to pay to borrow if they needed money,top and bottom 4 are discarded But LIBOR was fundamentally flawed - submission based on estimates on real trades so theres potntional to be manipulated by traders which is what happened
solution is to move to rfrs -
The solution was risk-free rates (RFRs). IBOR submissions for the coming 3–month or 6-month period were replaced by rates calculated using overnight rates obtained from prior period transactions with daily compounding used to derive a rate applicable for a future period. Overnight rates have only one day’s credit risk, so the rates are deemed risk-free.

Derivative valuations is a two-step process: 1) Predict cash flows created by changes in an index, 2) discount the cash flows to present value using risk-free rates obtained from a yield curve. Prior to IBOR transition, IBOR indices were the basis for both steps. The move to RFRs, however, triggered innovation that impacted these steps. First, a new set of index calculation and settlement conventions was developed to adjust for the backward looking, overnight-compounding RFRs. Second, the replacement of the single IBOR-based yield curve for each currency with an OIS discounting approach that added a credit spread to each currency’s overnight index swap (OIS) curve depending on the quality of collateral posted. A third, related, innovation was developed for uncollateralised derivatives. An upfront adjustment to the mark-to-market $valuation of the derivative was required to adjust for the credit risk of in-the-money positions. The adjustment is referred to as the credit valuation adjustment (CVA).


SOFR remained relatively stable around 2% until early 2020, then dropped sharply to near zero during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting emergency Federal Reserve rate cuts and market stress.

The chart below shows SONIA climbing steadily from mid-2022, peaking just above 5% in mid-2023, in direct response to aggressive Bank of England rate hikes aimed at combating inflation.

In 2024, SONIA begins to gradually decline, signaling a possible easing cycle or market anticipation of a policy shift.
Key Insight: SONIA’s movement closely mirrors the BoE's tightening and easing cycles, showing strong alignment between the benchmark and actual monetary policy.
€STR also rose significantly from late 2022, peaking slightly below 4%, lagging behind SONIA, due to the ECB’s more gradual policy tightening approach.


From early 2022, SOFR began a steep and consistent rise, mirroring the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation, reaching above 5% by 2025.
Transaction volume in the SOFR market (black line) has generally increased over time, peaking above $2.4 trillion in 2025, indicating robust liquidity and growing market adoption

Japan raised rates from 0% to positive for the first time in 17 years due to three key factors:

**1. Inflation Success**: Japan finally achieved "sustained inflation and rising wages" after decades of deflation.

**2. Wage Growth**: Rising wages created a virtuous cycle supporting consumer spending and economic growth.

**3. Yen Weakness**: The yen's ongoing depreciation pressured the BoJ to strengthen the currency through higher rates.



# EURIBOR Analysis: The Benchmark That Survived the Crisis

## What Makes EURIBOR Unique

**EURIBOR stands as the cornerstone of European money markets** - representing the rate at which eurozone banks lend to each other. Unlike many other benchmarks that faced extinction during the financial crisis, EURIBOR successfully adapted and remains central to European finance.

## Reading the Chart: A Story of Market Cycles

The EURIBOR chart tells a compelling story of European monetary policy and market dynamics:

**The Pre-Crisis Peak (2008-2009):**
- Rates soared above 5% during the financial crisis
- Reflects the severe credit stress and liquidity shortages in European banking
- Banks demanded higher premiums for lending to each other due to counterparty risk

**The Great Moderation (2010-2016):**
- Steady decline as the ECB implemented accommodative policies
- Rates moved from crisis highs toward zero
- Reflects the ECB's efforts to stimulate the European economy post-crisis

**The Negative Territory (2016-2022):**
- EURIBOR went negative, an unprecedented phenomenon
- Banks were essentially paying each other to take deposits
- Demonstrates the extreme nature of ECB's quantitative easing policies

**The Recent Normalization (2022-Present):**
- Sharp rise as the ECB began fighting inflation
- Different tenors (1-week, 1-month, 3-month) showing convergent behavior
- Reflects the synchronized tightening of European monetary policy

## Why EURIBOR Survived When Others Failed

**1. Successful Regulatory Reform:**
EURIBOR underwent comprehensive reforms following the LIBOR manipulation scandals. The hybrid methodology now combines actual transaction data with expert judgment, creating a more robust and manipulation-resistant benchmark.

**2. Market Integration:**
Unlike fragmented national markets, EURIBOR benefits from deep integration across the eurozone. This creates sufficient transaction volume and liquidity to support a transaction-based benchmark.

**3. Strong Governance Framework:**
The European Money Markets Institute (EMMI) established rigorous oversight, transparency requirements, and audit mechanisms that restored market confidence.

**4. Practical Necessity:**
With trillions of euros in contracts linked to EURIBOR, market participants had strong incentives to preserve and improve the benchmark rather than abandon it.

## Market Implications

**For Banks:** EURIBOR remains the primary reference for interbank lending, funding costs, and risk management across Europe.

**For Borrowers:** Millions of mortgages, corporate loans, and derivatives remain linked to EURIBOR, making its movements crucial for the real economy.

**For Policymakers:** EURIBOR serves as a key transmission mechanism for ECB policy, helping translate central bank decisions into market rates.

## Looking Forward

The recent normalization of EURIBOR rates signals Europe's transition from crisis-era monetary policy to more conventional settings. The benchmark's survival and adaptation demonstrate that with proper governance and regulatory oversight, financial benchmarks can maintain their credibility and market relevance even after facing existential challenges.

EURIBOR's success story offers valuable lessons for benchmark reform globally and reinforces its position as the backbone of European money markets.

The Bank of Japan moved rates from -0.1% in March 2024 to 0.5% by January 2025 - the highest since 2008. This signals confidence that Japan's economy can finally handle normal interest rates without falling back into deflation.
