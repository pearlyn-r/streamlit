In 1970 a syndicate of international banks arranged a loan to Iran for telecommunications infrastructure investment. It was a floating rate loan linked to an average of London interbank lending rates. The average rate was the first LIBOR index. Global capital markets, shut down since the 1929 stock market crash, had begun to open again. New IBOR indices evolved to meet demand for floating rate loans.Libor - 18 banks send everyday estimates on what they think they would have to pay to borrow if they needed money,top and bottom 4 are discarded But LIBOR was fundamentally flawed - submission based on estimates on real trades so theres potntional to be manipulated by traders which is what happened
solution is to move to rfrs -
The solution was risk-free rates (RFRs). IBOR submissions for the coming 3–month or 6-month period were replaced by rates calculated using overnight rates obtained from prior period transactions with daily compounding used to derive a rate applicable for a future period. Overnight rates have only one day’s credit risk, so the rates are deemed risk-free.

Derivative valuations is a two-step process: 1) Predict cash flows created by changes in an index, 2) discount the cash flows to present value using risk-free rates obtained from a yield curve. Prior to IBOR transition, IBOR indices were the basis for both steps. The move to RFRs, however, triggered innovation that impacted these steps. First, a new set of index calculation and settlement conventions was developed to adjust for the backward looking, overnight-compounding RFRs. Second, the replacement of the single IBOR-based yield curve for each currency with an OIS discounting approach that added a credit spread to each currency’s overnight index swap (OIS) curve depending on the quality of collateral posted. A third, related, innovation was developed for uncollateralised derivatives. An upfront adjustment to the mark-to-market $valuation of the derivative was required to adjust for the credit risk of in-the-money positions. The adjustment is referred to as the credit valuation adjustment (CVA).

Let's break down what happened to markets and their reaction to changes in key reference rates, particularly focusing on the period around COVID-19 and the subsequent years, leveraging the provided graphs for SOFR, SONIA, and ESTR.

What Happened to Markets and Their Reaction to Rate Changes
The period from 2020 onwards has been one of the most dynamic for financial markets in recent history, largely driven by global events and the corresponding actions of central banks on interest rates.

The COVID-19 Shock (Early 2020)
Market Impact: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 triggered an unprecedented and swift global economic shutdown. Financial markets reacted with extreme panic and volatility. We saw sharp sell-offs across equity markets (e.g., the S&P 500 experiencing its fastest-ever bear market), a severe "dash for cash" that even affected the liquidity of safe assets like U.S. Treasuries, and widespread market dysfunction.
Central Bank Reaction & Rate Changes:
United States (SOFR): As seen in the "SOFR Rate & Transaction Volume (2018-2025)" graph (image_6ed257.png), the Federal Reserve acted swiftly and decisively. The SOFR (blue line) dropped dramatically to near 0% in March 2020. This was a direct result of the Fed slashing the federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%.
Europe (SONIA & ESTR): Similarly, the Bank of England (for SONIA) and the European Central Bank (for ESTR) also moved their respective overnight rates to historically low, and in some cases, negative territory, to combat the economic fallout. The SONIA and ESTR charts (image_6ef461.png) would likely show rates flatlining at very low levels during this period.
Market Reaction to Near-Zero Rates:
Stabilization and Liquidity: The primary goal of these near-zero rates, combined with massive quantitative easing and liquidity programs (e.g., increased repo operations, asset purchases), was to stabilize financial markets, restore liquidity, and prevent a credit crunch. The sheer scale and speed of central bank intervention eventually calmed the initial panic.
Asset Price Recovery: The ultra-low interest rates made borrowing incredibly cheap and significantly boosted the present value of future earnings for companies. This fueled a remarkable rebound and sustained rally in equity markets from late March 2020 onwards, despite ongoing economic uncertainty. Investors sought higher returns in riskier assets, as safe haven yields were negligible.
"Reach for Yield": This period saw investors aggressively "reaching for yield," pushing into higher-risk bonds, dividend stocks, and even speculative assets, as traditional fixed-income returns were minimal.
The Inflation Surge and Rate Hikes (2022-2024/2025)
Market Impact: Following the COVID-induced downturn, a combination of supply chain disruptions, strong consumer demand (fueled by fiscal stimulus), and geopolitical events (like the war in Ukraine) led to a significant surge in inflation globally. Central banks, initially considering inflation "transitory," began to realize its persistence.
Central Bank Reaction & Rate Changes:
United States (SOFR): The "SOFR Rate & Transaction Volume" graph clearly illustrates this shift. Starting in early 2022, the SOFR (blue line) began a steep ascent, surging past 5% by 2025 (as noted in the graph's text). This directly tracks the aggressive Fed rate hikes initiated to combat inflation.
Europe (SONIA & ESTR): The SONIA and ESTR charts would show similar upward trends from 2022 onwards, as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank also began their own series of rate increases to bring inflation under control in their respective regions.
Market Reaction to Rising Rates:
Cooling Inflation, but Economic Concerns: The primary goal of these hikes was to cool inflation by making borrowing more expensive, thereby reducing demand. Markets generally reacted by showing signs of economic slowdown, with concerns about potential recessions increasing.
Equity Market Volatility: Rising rates generally make equities less attractive as the cost of capital increases for companies, and bond yields offer more competitive returns. This led to increased volatility and corrections in equity markets in 2022, particularly for growth stocks that rely heavily on future earnings.
Bond Market Sell-off: Fixed-income markets experienced significant sell-offs as bond yields rose. Existing bonds with lower interest rates became less attractive, leading to price declines.
Impact on Borrowing Costs: For consumers and businesses, the rising SOFR, SONIA, and ESTR translated directly into higher borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, corporate loans, and other variable-rate debt.
Fun Facts & Notable Events During This Period:
"Everything Bubble" (Pre-Rate Hikes): During the ultra-low rate environment post-COVID, some analysts and economists warned of an "everything bubble," suggesting that virtually all asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, cryptocurrencies) had become overvalued due to abundant liquidity and low discount rates.
The Rise of Meme Stocks (2021): The period of easy money and retail investor engagement saw the phenomenon of "meme stocks" like GameStop and AMC. Highly coordinated buying by individual investors, fueled by social media, led to massive short squeezes and unprecedented volatility, challenging traditional institutional investors.
The Great Resignation (2021-2022): Fueled by a combination of factors, including pandemic-related shifts in priorities, generous government stimulus, and a tight labor market, many workers voluntarily left their jobs. This contributed to wage inflation, making the Fed's job of taming inflation even harder.
Crypto Mania and Subsequent "Crypto Winter": The low-interest-rate environment heavily contributed to the speculative boom in cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs. However, as central banks began tightening monetary policy, the crypto market experienced a significant "crypto winter" (or crash) in 2022, highlighting its sensitivity to global liquidity conditions.
SOFR Volume Surge: The "SOFR Rate & Transaction Volume" graph (image_6ed257.png) shows that SOFR transaction volume climbed steadily, peaking at $2.4 trillion. This is a significant "fun fact" demonstrating the successful and massive transition from LIBOR to SOFR as the primary benchmark for overnight secured lending in the U.S. market. It underscores the depth and liquidity of the Treasury repo market.
In conclusion, the period from 2020 to 2025 (as depicted) represents a dramatic swing in monetary policy, from extreme accommodation to aggressive tightening, driven by the COVID-19 shock and subsequent inflation. Market reactions mirrored these shifts, moving from initial panic to asset price recovery and then to re-pricing risk in the face of higher borrowing costs. The transition to robust, transaction-based rates like SOFR, SONIA, and ESTR has proven crucial in navigating these turbulent times.


Our focus will be on the trend analysis, the market's reaction to these profound changes, why these rates evolved, and the effect they've had on our financial landscape.

The Dawn of SOFR: A Response to Crisis
Let's begin our journey in the United States with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. The birth of SOFR was not a gradual evolution, but a direct, urgent response to a crisis of confidence. For decades, LIBOR stood as the bedrock of global finance, but its reliance on panel bank submissions and its susceptibility to manipulation became painfully clear during the financial crisis and subsequent scandals.

The trend was undeniable: LIBOR was broken, and its fundamental design, based on expert judgment rather than observable transactions, made it unreliable. The market reaction was initially one of trepidation. How could we possibly transition trillions of dollars in contracts away from such an entrenched benchmark?

The "why" behind SOFR was simple: to build a more robust, transparent, and transaction-based rate. SOFR is based on actual overnight repurchase agreements, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. This makes it virtually risk-free, reflecting the true cost of overnight borrowing against high-quality collateral.


The effect? A monumental shift in the way U.S. dollar financial products are priced. It necessitated an enormous operational lift for banks, corporations, and investors to update systems, contracts, and risk models. While challenging, the transition to SOFR has brought greater stability and credibility to the U.S. dollar interest rate market, moving us towards a safer and more resilient financial system.

SONIA: The UK's Pioneering Spirit
Across the Atlantic, the UK led the charge with SONIA – the Sterling Overnight Index Average. Similar to SOFR, SONIA’s rise was propelled by the need to replace Sterling LIBOR. The trend here was again a clear move away from unsecured, expert-judgment-based rates towards a truly overnight, transaction-based alternative.

The market reaction in the UK was arguably more proactive, given the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) clear directive and strong push for the transition. SONIA, in its refined form, reflects the average rate paid by banks for overnight unsecured sterling deposits.

The "why" was the same imperative for robustness and transparency. The "effect" has been a successful and relatively smooth transition in the sterling markets. SONIA is now firmly embedded in derivatives, loans, and bonds, demonstrating that with clear guidance and market engagement, a major benchmark transition is achievable. It has provided the UK financial system with a more reliable and resilient foundation for pricing sterling-denominated instruments.

€STR: Unifying the Eurozone
Now, let's turn to the Eurozone with the Euro Short-Term Rate, or €STR. The trend here was about establishing a truly representative, risk-free overnight rate for the vast and diverse euro area. While Euribor remained, the European Central Bank (ECB) recognized the need for an additional, pure overnight risk-free rate that could serve as a solid foundation for financial contracts, independent of credit risk.

The market reaction to €STR was largely positive, recognizing its complementary role to Euribor. It’s based on actual overnight unsecured borrowing transactions by banks in the euro money market.

The "why" for €STR was to provide a robust, pan-Eurozone overnight reference rate that is less susceptible to market disruptions and does not include a credit premium. This enhances financial stability and provides a clear alternative for those seeking a credit-risk-free benchmark.

The effect has been the emergence of a dual-rate environment in the Eurozone, where €STR serves as the go-to for overnight risk-free transactions, particularly in the derivatives market, while Euribor continues to serve other segments. This provides market participants with greater flexibility and precision in managing their interest rate exposures.

TONAR: Japan's Path to Stability
Moving to Asia, we encounter TONAR – the Tokyo Overnight Average Rate. Japan’s journey with its benchmarks has mirrored the global trend, driven by the same lessons learned from LIBOR. The "why" for TONAR was to replace JPY LIBOR with a robust, transaction-based overnight rate.


The market reaction in Japan has seen a concerted effort to shift from LIBOR to TONAR across various financial products. TONAR is based on the uncollateralized overnight call rate in the Japanese money market, making it a reliable indicator of the short-term cost of funding for Japanese yen.

The effect of TONAR's adoption is the creation of a more stable and credible benchmark for the Japanese yen. It has allowed for the continued growth of Japan's derivatives market and ensures that financial contracts are priced off a rate that truly reflects market activity, strengthening the integrity of the Japanese financial system.

Euribor: Resilience and Reform
Finally, let's return to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor. Unlike LIBOR, which was ultimately decommissioned, Euribor stands as a testament to successful reform. The initial trend for Euribor, following the manipulation scandals, was a serious threat of discontinuation. The market reaction was one of intense scrutiny and concern.

However, the "why" it survived is crucial: Euribor underwent significant and proactive reform under the EU Benchmark Regulation (BMR). Its methodology was revamped to a "hybrid" model, prioritizing actual transaction data when available, and only resorting to expert judgment when necessary, under strict oversight. This addressed the fundamental flaw that led to LIBOR's demise.

The effect has been its continued systemic importance. While €STR caters to the overnight risk-free segment, Euribor remains vital for longer-term euro-denominated financial products like mortgages and corporate loans, where a credit component is inherent and desired by market participants. Its continued use reflects the market's acceptance of its reformed, more robust structure. It demonstrates that not all benchmarks need to be abandoned if they can be fundamentally reformed to meet new regulatory standards and market demands for transparency and reliability.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the journey from SOFR to Euribor underscores a powerful global trend: the unwavering commitment to more robust, transparent, and transaction-based interest rate benchmarks. The market's reaction, while initially hesitant, has evolved into a collective effort to adapt and build a more resilient financial system. The "why" behind these changes is rooted in the pursuit of integrity and stability, and the "effect" has been a profound re-calibration of how financial risk is priced and managed.

These new benchmarks are not just numbers; they are the very scaffolding of our financial world, ensuring that markets function fairly and reliably. As we move forward, continuous vigilance and adaptation will be key to maintaining the integrity of these vital financial indicators.

Thank you.


OR Transition and its Impact: A Thorough Explanation
The graph is broadly divided into three main sections:

Growth of the IBORs (Left Column): A historical timeline of how IBORs emerged and expanded.
Innovation / Risk Free Rates (Center Section): Explaining the shift from IBORs to new "Risk Free Rates" (RFRs) for derivative valuation.
Indices for Derivs Valuation (Right Section): Details on the components of derivative valuation that changed with the IBOR transition.
Section 1: Growth of the IBORs (Left Column - Historical Timeline)
This column provides a historical context for the rise and fall of IBORs.

1960s: Eurodollar Market
This marks the genesis. The Eurodollar market refers to U.S. dollar-denominated deposits held in banks outside the United States. It developed to circumvent regulations and taxes in the U.S. domestic market.
1970: 1st loan uses Lon Avg Rate
The first loans began to be benchmarked against an average London rate, laying the groundwork for LIBOR.
Banks create LIBOR: Banks effectively created LIBOR by submitting estimates of what they would charge other banks for short-term, unsecured loans.
1980s: OTC Derivs linked to LIBOR
Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives (financial contracts traded directly between two parties, not on exchanges) began using LIBOR as their reference rate. This significantly expanded LIBOR's influence.
IBOR Uncontrolled Expansion: IBORs, particularly LIBOR, became the benchmark for trillions of dollars in financial products worldwide, including mortgages, corporate loans, and derivatives. This expansion was largely unregulated initially.
BBA Admin of LIBOR: The British Bankers' Association (BBA) became the administrator of LIBOR, responsible for collecting submissions and calculating the rate.
Rates Published 11 am: LIBOR rates were typically published at 11:00 AM London time each business day.
1999: EURIBOR created
With the introduction of the Euro, EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) was created as a benchmark for the Eurozone interbank market, similar to LIBOR.
$400 Tr IBOR linked Debt: This staggering figure highlights the immense volume of financial contracts (estimated at $400 trillion globally) that were directly tied to IBORs, making their accuracy and integrity critical to the global financial system.
2008: Global Financial Crisis
This was a pivotal moment. The GFC exposed significant vulnerabilities in the financial system. Banks became much less willing to lend to each other on an unsecured basis, making the "interbank offered rate" less representative of actual market activity.
Banks manipulating IBOR: Post-GFC investigations revealed widespread manipulation of LIBOR by banks seeking to profit from their positions or appear more creditworthy during the crisis. This scandal severely damaged the credibility of IBORs.
Section 2: Innovation / Risk Free Rates (Center Section - The Transition)
This section illustrates the shift from IBOR-based valuations to those based on new Risk Free Rates (RFRs).

Innovation (Central Yellow Circle): This represents the global effort to reform and replace IBORs due to their inherent flaws (lack of underlying transactions, susceptibility to manipulation).
From IBOR to RFRs for Derivatives Valuation:
Indices for Derivs Valuation: This is the core shift. Previously, derivatives were valued using forward curves and yield curves based on IBORs.
"Today" (Central Point): This represents the current state of transition.
T-3M (Past 3 Months): Reflects the previous state where IBORs were still heavily used.
Forward Curve: Euribor (Estimate): For valuing future cash flows in derivatives, a forward curve based on Euribor was used. This was an estimate of future Euribor rates.
Yield Curve: Euribor (Estimate): For discounting future cash flows back to present value, a yield curve based on Euribor was used.
T+3M (Future 3 Months): Reflects the future state where RFRs are the primary benchmarks.
Forward Curve: Hybrid Euribor (Estimate): The forward curve shifts to a "hybrid" model, where Euribor remains but its construction and reliance might be integrated with new RFRs, especially for cross-currency or legacy contracts.
Yield Curve: ESTR (Transactions): The yield curve for discounting moves to ESTR (Euro Short-Term Rate). The crucial difference is that ESTR is based on actual transactions in the overnight unsecured lending market, making it more robust and less susceptible to manipulation than panel-based rates like Euribor.
Risk Free Rates (Sub-section below "Innovation"):
IRS Clearing moves to CCPs: Interest Rate Swaps (IRS), previously traded bilaterally (OTC), increasingly moved to central clearing counterparties (CCPs). CCPs manage counterparty risk and standardize contracts, which facilitated the transition to new benchmarks.
Hybrid EURIBOR - Txns: This reinforces the idea that the new Euribor is based on more transactions, increasing its reliability, or that it becomes a hybrid of transaction data and expert judgment.
2019: EONIA replaced by ESTR - Txns: EONIA (Euro OverNight Index Average) was an earlier Eurozone overnight rate. It was replaced by ESTR in 2019, explicitly stated as being based on "transactions," highlighting the shift to observable, transaction-based rates.
2023: SOFR replaces USD LIBOR: This is a key milestone. SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) replaced USD LIBOR for new contracts in 2023. SOFR is based on overnight repurchase agreements (repos), which are secured, making it a "risk-free" rate.
Section 3: Indices for Derivs Valuation (Right Section - Impact on Derivative Valuation)
This section explains how the components of derivative valuation change in the post-IBOR world. The arrows labeled 1, 2, and 3 emanating from "Innovation" lead to these changes.

1. OIS Discounting:

OIS (Overnight Index Swap) Discounting: This refers to the method of discounting future cash flows in derivatives.
"Now" vs. "1Yr": This illustrates how the discounting curve is built.
Multi Curve: Previously, a single curve might have been used for both forecasting and discounting. The IBOR transition necessitated a "multi-curve" framework where different curves are used for forecasting (e.g., still some IBORs for legacy) and discounting (OIS based on RFRs).
Components of Discounting:
Future Cashflow: The projected payments from the derivative.
Collateral Posted: The collateral exchanged between parties in a derivative contract.
Discount Factor: The rate used to bring future cash flows back to present value.
Impact: The move to OIS discounting using RFRs (like SOFR, ESTR) means that collateral is now also discounted using these "risk-free" rates, which is more theoretically sound and less subject to manipulation than IBOR-based discounting.
2. CVA (Credit Valuation Adjustment) & DVA (Debit Valuation Adjustment):

These are adjustments to the fair value of a derivative to account for the credit risk of the counterparty (CVA) and the credit risk of the bank itself (DVA).
CVA (Green Circle: Unrealised Gains) and DVA (Red Circle: Unrealised Losses):
Unrealised Gains (CVA): This is the cost to the bank of potential default by its counterparty on a derivative where the bank has an unrealized gain. It's an adjustment for the bank's exposure to the counterparty's credit risk.
Unrealised Losses (DVA): This is the gain to the bank from its own credit risk when it has an unrealized loss on a derivative. If the bank's creditworthiness declines, its liabilities become less valuable, leading to a "gain" on its own derivative losses.
Bank's own Credit Risk vs. Counterparty Credit Risk: The graph visually separates these two components.
P&L (Profit & Loss): Indicates that these adjustments impact the bank's P&L.
Time: These adjustments evolve over time as credit spreads and market conditions change.
Impact: The IBOR transition and the increased use of RFRs affect the valuation of derivatives, which in turn influences the calculation of CVA and DVA, potentially leading








From early 2022, SOFR began a steep and consistent rise, mirroring the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation, reaching above 5% by 2025.
Transaction volume in the SOFR market (black line) has generally increased over time, peaking above $2.4 trillion in 2025, indicating robust liquidity and growing market adoption

Japan raised rates from 0% to positive for the first time in 17 years due to three key factors:

**1. Inflation Success**: Japan finally achieved "sustained inflation and rising wages" after decades of deflation.

**2. Wage Growth**: Rising wages created a virtuous cycle supporting consumer spending and economic growth.

**3. Yen Weakness**: The yen's ongoing depreciation pressured the BoJ to strengthen the currency through higher rates.



# EURIBOR Analysis: The Benchmark That Survived the Crisis

## What Makes EURIBOR Unique

**EURIBOR stands as the cornerstone of European money markets** - representing the rate at which eurozone banks lend to each other. Unlike many other benchmarks that faced extinction during the financial crisis, EURIBOR successfully adapted and remains central to European finance.

## Reading the Chart: A Story of Market Cycles

The EURIBOR chart tells a compelling story of European monetary policy and market dynamics:

**The Pre-Crisis Peak (2008-2009):**
- Rates soared above 5% during the financial crisis
- Reflects the severe credit stress and liquidity shortages in European banking
- Banks demanded higher premiums for lending to each other due to counterparty risk

**The Great Moderation (2010-2016):**
- Steady decline as the ECB implemented accommodative policies
- Rates moved from crisis highs toward zero
- Reflects the ECB's efforts to stimulate the European economy post-crisis

**The Negative Territory (2016-2022):**
- EURIBOR went negative, an unprecedented phenomenon
- Banks were essentially paying each other to take deposits
- Demonstrates the extreme nature of ECB's quantitative easing policies

**The Recent Normalization (2022-Present):**
- Sharp rise as the ECB began fighting inflation
- Different tenors (1-week, 1-month, 3-month) showing convergent behavior
- Reflects the synchronized tightening of European monetary policy

## Why EURIBOR Survived When Others Failed

**1. Successful Regulatory Reform:**
EURIBOR underwent comprehensive reforms following the LIBOR manipulation scandals. The hybrid methodology now combines actual transaction data with expert judgment, creating a more robust and manipulation-resistant benchmark.

**2. Market Integration:**
Unlike fragmented national markets, EURIBOR benefits from deep integration across the eurozone. This creates sufficient transaction volume and liquidity to support a transaction-based benchmark.

**3. Strong Governance Framework:**
The European Money Markets Institute (EMMI) established rigorous oversight, transparency requirements, and audit mechanisms that restored market confidence.

**4. Practical Necessity:**
With trillions of euros in contracts linked to EURIBOR, market participants had strong incentives to preserve and improve the benchmark rather than abandon it.

## Market Implications

**For Banks:** EURIBOR remains the primary reference for interbank lending, funding costs, and risk management across Europe.

**For Borrowers:** Millions of mortgages, corporate loans, and derivatives remain linked to EURIBOR, making its movements crucial for the real economy.

**For Policymakers:** EURIBOR serves as a key transmission mechanism for ECB policy, helping translate central bank decisions into market rates.

## Looking Forward

The recent normalization of EURIBOR rates signals Europe's transition from crisis-era monetary policy to more conventional settings. The benchmark's survival and adaptation demonstrate that with proper governance and regulatory oversight, financial benchmarks can maintain their credibility and market relevance even after facing existential challenges.

EURIBOR's success story offers valuable lessons for benchmark reform globally and reinforces its position as the backbone of European money markets.

The Bank of Japan moved rates from -0.1% in March 2024 to 0.5% by January 2025 - the highest since 2008. This signals confidence that Japan's economy can finally handle normal interest rates without falling back into deflation.
